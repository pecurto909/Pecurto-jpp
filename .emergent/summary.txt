The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of a 3D GPS application for Renault Talisman. Following the rapid MVP development strategy, the engineer identified the core feature (3D landscape/maps) and a critical external dependency (MapBox API key). Instead of waiting for the key, the engineer proceeded to build the foundational UI and backend with a placeholder key, aiming for an early aha moment. This involved rewriting , , and  in a single bulk operation. The work paused at the point of requesting the actual MapBox API key from the user to fully activate the 3D mapping capabilities, demonstrating adherence to the ask for input guideline for external integrations. The engineer adhered to strict environment rules, utilizing provided UI components and managing environment variables correctly.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a GPS application specifically designed for a Renault Talisman car. The initial request was for a GPS app for Renault Talisman, which was later clarified to specifically include 3D landscape (paysage en 3D). The application should provide a modern automotive-style GPS interface, real-time navigation via WebSockets, route calculation, favorites management, speed display, and an activatable 3D view with terrain. The design must be adapted for Renault Talisman aesthetics. The backend should be robust, providing necessary API endpoints. The core functionality, including the display of 3D maps and realistic landscapes, is contingent on the integration of MapBox, requiring a user-provided API key.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **UI Framework:** Shadcn/ui (pre-provided components in ).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for modern, aesthetic design.
- **Mapping:** MapBox for 3D maps and landscape rendering.
- **Backend Communication:** FastAPI for REST APIs, WebSockets for real-time navigation.
- **Data Handling:** Pydantic models for data validation, UUIDs for IDs (instead of MongoDB ObjectIDs), UTC ISO strings for DateTime.
- **Deployment Environment:** Kubernetes, Supervisor for process management,  for environment variables, strict URL and port management (e.g.,  prefix for backend routes).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data storage.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** This is the main FastAPI application file, serving as the core of the backend logic. It defines API endpoints and WebSocket routes necessary for GPS functionalities.
    -   **Changes Made:** Rewritten to include initial API routes for features like real-time navigation, route calculation, favorites, and speed display. It also sets up WebSocket handling. Database connection (using  from ) and CORS handling are maintained as per environment guidelines.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** The main React component that structures and renders the entire frontend user interface of the GPS application.
    -   **Changes Made:** Rewritten to implement the core GPS UI. This includes: a header with Renault Talisman branding, a GPS logo, an GPS Actif badge, and a Vue 3D button. A sidebar integrates search and other functionalities, and a large section is dedicated to the map display area. It uses  for API calls and incorporates a placeholder for the MapBox API key. All UI components from  are utilized.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Contains the global CSS styles and Tailwind CSS directives that define the visual appearance and layout of the React application.
    -   **Changes Made:** Rewritten to apply modern, aesthetic styling consistent with the design guidelines. This includes defining overall layout, typography, color schemes (avoiding prohibited gradients/colors), and spacing, ensuring a polished look for the automotive GPS interface.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Environment variable file for the frontend, crucial for configuring external URLs and API keys.
    -   **Changes Made:** The file now contains  (pre-existing) and has been updated to include a placeholder for the , which is required for 3D map integration.

- Obtain the actual MapBox API key from the user.
- Replace the placeholder  in the frontend code with the user-provided MapBox API key to enable full 3D map functionality with realistic landscapes.

<current_work>
The application's core MVP is in place, demonstrating a functional GPS interface for Renault Talisman. The frontend, accessible at , is fully loaded. It displays a header with Renault Talisman branding and a GPS logo, a GPS Actif badge, and a Vue 3D button. A sidebar provides search and other GPS features, while the main content area is allocated for the map display. Crucially, a message regarding MapBox configuration is visible, indicating the current reliance on a placeholder API key.

The backend, developed with FastAPI, is set up to support real-time navigation (via WebSockets), route calculation, favorites management, and speed display. While the UI and backend logic for these features are established, the complete visualization of 3D maps and realistic landscapes is pending the integration of a valid MapBox API key. The previous AI engineer has built out the foundational structure and is now awaiting this critical input from the user to finalize the mapping feature.
